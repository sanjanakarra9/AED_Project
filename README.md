This repo is for info 5100 final project fall 2022 semester

### Context
Gym visits have become a habit as people become more conscious of their health and well-being, so having applications that cater to the needs of gyms is critical. Making sure that the application is scalable is the most important aspect of the design process. When the systems are not interconnected, this makes it harder and sometimes impossible for the business to have multiple services under a single system. Gym management systems are web-based projects that are used by gym managers and customers. This software is used to save records of customers related to their fitness, schedule, orders and personal details. Because of this, the work of the gym manager becomes easy and time-saving. The gym management system provides an easy-to-use interface for the users and a database for the admin to maintain the records.
The main aim of the project is to provide the administrator and the user with a platform to interact online about every piece of information and detail required and to make sure the gym is well maintained. It makes it easy for both the admin and the users to stay updated about courses being offered, schedules, Orders, etc.
